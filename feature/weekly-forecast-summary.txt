Feature Name: Weekly Forecast Summary

Problem:
The current Weather App displays only the daily weather for a selected city. 
Users have no way to quickly view the full 7-day forecast, which makes planning activities for the week harder. 
Currently, users need to check the app every day to get the forecast, which is not convenient.

Proposed Solution:
Add a weekly forecast summary section below the current daily weather display. 
This section will show the next 7 days in a simple card or table format. Each day’s card will display:
- Day of the week
- Minimum and maximum temperature
- Weather condition icon (sun, cloud, rain, etc.)
- Optional precipitation chance or humidity

Implementation Details:
- **HTML**: Create a container section for the 7-day cards.
- **CSS**: Use flexbox or grid to layout the cards responsively for mobile and desktop.
- **JavaScript**: 
    - Use the existing weather API to fetch 7-day forecast data (if API supports 7-day forecast). 
    - Dynamically generate the 7-day cards with JS.
    - Format dates using `Date` object to show the day name.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the cards display nicely on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Optional Enhancements**: Highlight the current day, show tooltip with extra info on hover.

Alternatives Considered:
- Using detailed charts (like line graphs or bar charts) to show weekly forecast. 
  But simple cards are easier to implement with current HTML/CSS/JS setup and maintain the app’s lightweight nature.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid) for layout and styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for dynamic card generation and API integration
- Existing Weather API (OpenWeatherMap or similar) for 7-day forecast data
- Optional: FontAwesome or weather icons library for visual enhancements

Additional Context:
- No user login or database required; all data is fetched dynamically from the API.
- Improves user experience by allowing quick week-long planning.
- Maintainers can later enhance it further (e.g., add tooltips, animations, or user preferences) without changing core app architecture.
- Fully compatible with Hacktoberfest PR guidelines as a feature suggestion.
