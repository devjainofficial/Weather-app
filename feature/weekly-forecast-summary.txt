Feature Name: Weekly (7-day) Forecast Summary

Problem:
The current Weather App displays only a 3-day weather forecast for a selected city. 
Users cannot quickly view the full week’s weather, which makes planning activities for the entire week less convenient.

Proposed Solution:
Add a weekly forecast summary section that displays the next 7 days in a simple card or table format. 
Each day’s card will display:
- Day of the week
- Minimum and maximum temperature
- Weather condition icon (sun, cloud, rain, etc.)
- Optional precipitation chance or humidity

Implementation Details:
- HTML: Create a container section for the 7-day cards.
- CSS: Use Flexbox or Grid to layout the cards responsively for mobile and desktop.
- JavaScript (ES6+): 
    - Use the existing weather API to fetch 7-day forecast data (if supported).
    - Dynamically generate the 7-day cards.
    - Format dates using the Date object to display day names.
- Optional Enhancements: Highlight the current day, show tooltip with extra info, or use weather icons library for better visualization.

Alternatives Considered:
- Using detailed charts (line graphs or bar charts) was considered, but simple cards are easier to implement, maintain, and fit the lightweight structure of the current app.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Existing weather API for 7-day forecast data
- Optional: weather icons library for better visuals

Additional Context:
- No user login required; fully compatible with the current app structure.
- Improves usability by allowing users to quickly view a full week’s forecast at a glance.
- Beginner-friendly and Hacktoberfest-eligible.
